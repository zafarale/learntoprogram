# Learning How to Program

## Languages
Learning a programming language can be dividied into two tasks;

1. Learning Language and it constructs.
2. Learning Library (Core + Core Extended)
   
This repository will serve as resource to learn similary concepts in various programming langaugaes.
- C/C++
- Rust
- Go
- Java
- JavaScript
  
## Tools
Each language or its ecosystem provides some almost defacto standard for building and deplying code, for example Rust adopted Cargo as a tool to manage depedencies and build codebases; following is the list of tools we will be using across thsi series.

- C/C++
  - https://gcc.gnu.org/
  - https://www.gnu.org/software/make/
- Rust  
  - https://www.rust-lang.org/tools/install
  - https://doc.rust-lang.org/cargo/index.html
  - https://github.com/rust-lang/rust-clippy
- GO
  - https://go.dev/dl/
- Java
  - https://jdk.java.net/
  - https://maven.apache.org/install.html
  - https://www.jenv.be/
- Javascript
  - https://github.com/nvm-sh/nvm           (NVM can manage installation of nodejs)
  - https://nodejs.org/en/download/current  (Please sue NVM to install lateset nodejs version)
### Compilation
    
    1. Preprocessor
        - Source code
    2. Compiler
        - Include Headers
        - Expand acro
    3. Assembler
        - Assembly Code

    4. Linker
       - Linking extenral libraries
       - Executable
